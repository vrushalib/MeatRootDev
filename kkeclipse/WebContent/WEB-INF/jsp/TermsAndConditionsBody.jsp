<br><br><b>2. GENERAL</b>
<br>2.1 We aim to excel in the quality of our produce and the service we provide. By shopping with us online you can expect high standards, just as our trade customers do.
<br>
<br>2.2 All our goods and services comply with all the standards required by relevant legislation. When shopping with us online, a Contract of Sale is made at the time we accept your order, and the contract shall be under Indian law, irrespective of where you are. By placing your order you accept these terms and conditions.
<br>
<br><b>3. DELIVERY</b>
<br>3.1 MeatRoot makes a charge to cover the cost of packing and delivery; this cost is calculated for you automatically, and you will see the full price before placing your order. Our Website will give relevant details.
<br>
<br>3.2 All orders are despatched on the next-day of the customer placing the order (see our delivery policy for more information). This ensures that goods are maintained in perfect condition during transit. The drivers know they are carrying perishable goods. 
<br>
<br>3.3 Delivery of the Goods shall be made to the Buyer's address specified in the order and the Buyer shall make all arrangements necessary to take delivery of the Goods whenever they are tendered for delivery. The delivery shall be deemed to have been made either when the buyer accepts delivery in person, or when the driver leaves your chill-pack at the premises (in case noone is at the delivery address to receive the delivery and the payment has already been made).
<br>
<br>3.4 Where a specific delivery date has been agreed, and where this delivery date cannot be met, the Buyer will be notified and given the opportunity to agree to a new delivery date or receive a full refund.
<br>
<br>3.5 Risk in the Goods shall pass to the Buyer upon delivery of the Goods, or where the Buyer fails to take delivery at the agreed time, at the time delivery was attempted.
<br>
<br>3.6 Title in the Goods shall not pass to the Buyer until payment of the price has been made in full.
<br>
<br>3.7 If the customer refuses a delivery for whatever reason, the parcel is automatically returned to the Supplier and a return delivery charge is applied to the Buyer.
<br>
<br>3.8 You must inspect the Products as soon as possible after delivery and notify us promptly if you find any defects, by calling us, emailing us or writing to us at the telephone number or address shown on our Website. We will replace or refund you for defective Products. 
<br>
<br><b>4. PACKAGING FOR DELIVERY</b>
<br>4.1 You may rest assured we have taken great care to ensure your goods arrive in best condition. Our packaging standard has been carefully designed to maintain a temperature within the chill-pack of less than 5oC for 48 hours - double the time your chill-pack should spend in transit. Your produce will be vacuum packed in a food-safe polythene pouch, then placed in a rigid polystyrene outer box, the 'chill-pack'. In local areas only, we will deliver directly from our depot to your door in our own refrigerated vehicle, and packaging will vary from that described above.
<br>
<br><b>5. UNFULFILLED ORDERS</b>
<br>5.1 Because of the nature of some of our produce and limited supply, it is possible that from time to time, we may be unable to fulfil some orders. If your order cannot be fulfilled, we will let you know as quickly as possible, normally within few hours of you placing the order, and offer alternative produce or cancellation at your discretion. In the event of us having to cancel, we will make an immediate and full refund of any amount paid.
<br>
<br><b>6. PRICE AND PAYMENT</b>
<br>6.1 The price of the Goods and/or Services shall be that stipulated on the Website. The price is inclusive of VAT.

<br>
<br>6.3 Payment of the price plus VAT and delivery charges, if applicable, must be made at the point of ordering or after receiving the goods in case cash on delivery option has been chosen.
<br>
<br>6.4 In terms of products ordered in advance payment of the price plus VAT and delivery charges, must be made at the point of ordering although orders will not be delivered until the agreed specified date.
<br>
<br>6.5 Where applicable, if any payment is not paid on time or any payment is rejected or refused, the amount owing will be treated as overdue and the Supplier will be entitled immediately to cease or suspend the provision of any Service or further deliveries of Goods until payment has been received.
