		    			As per our cancellation policy, cancellation will be considered only if requested within 1 hour of order placement. However, there won't be any cancellation if order is in process state. For fresh category order, there won't be any cancellation as being fresh they have very less shelf life and can not be given to any other customer. We can possibly store the order for 12 hours in our cold storage and deliver it as frozen at next slot with incurred charges of Rs. 30.
	<br><br>
Once the refund is approved it may take 2 working days to initiate the refund request and you will receive a refund confirmation message/mail within that period. Please note in refund cases, the concerned bank may take 4-7 working days to post a credit to your account.
