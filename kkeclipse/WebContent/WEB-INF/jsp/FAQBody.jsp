<b>1: Where is MeatRoot's meat sourced from?</b><br/><br/>
We source meat from only the best brands and free range farms that meet our quality standards
and allow their animals to live in conditions we approve of.<br/><br/>
<b>2: How fresh is MeatRoot's meat?</b> <br/><br/>
We at MeatRoot operate only against orders. We do not store anything frozen as far as fresh supply is concerned. 
Once we close our orders we start to process all the orders in a very custom fashion. Every pack is custom handled to 
incorporate all the instructions shared at the time of placing order. We do not encourage default packs as dimensions of pieces 
differs from  preparation to preparation. For example, salad requires smaller cubes whereas biryani required bigger pieces.
And all this happens just couple of hours before the delivery. Post processing packet gets stored at 4 degree celsius just to chill those 
packs. Temprature at this stage is carefully maintained ensuring meat texture stays unaffected and firm. <br/><br/>

<b>3: Which products come under frozen range?</b> <br/><br/>
MeatRoot is an exclusive platform for meat & meat products. Apart from fresh meat, we do have processed delicacies like ready to cook starters, 
cold cuts, Sausages, imported fish, etc. We also keep few indian fish in frozen range to keep up with the demand. <br><br/>
 
<b>4: Is frozen meat healthy?</b><br/><br/>
Freezing is the best method of extending the useful shelf life of meat. It preserves freshness,
taste, nutritional value and quality. The freezing process itself does not destroy nutrients and
there is little change in nutrient value during freezer storage. Small amounts of nutrients (salts,
peptides, amino acids, and watersoluble
vitamins) may be lost as drip when the meat is
thawed. The freshness of frozen meat can be maintained for up to 6 months under appropriate
storage conditions while unrefrigerated meat can go stale and spoil within a day.<br/><br/>

<b>5: What is IQF?</b><br/><br/>
Individual Quick Frozen. It is the technique in which seafoods are frozen as individual pieces by
direct CONTACT with nitrogen vapours and liquid nitrogen spray. This is the only process
whereby, virtually all the properties of most of the parent foodstuffs can be preserved.IQF is a
preferred method over usual block freezing because consumers can use only as much of the
product as they need, eliminating the need to defrost the whole box.<br/><br/>
<b>6: How is frozen fish through IQF technique better than fresh fish?</b><br/><br/>
So called fresh fish actually takes minimum 2-3
days to reach your kitchen. During the transit period, it
is preserved using methods like block freezing, dry ice, etc. causing cellular damage and
moisture loss.
Where in IQF, the catch is quickly cleaned, spread out (to prevent clumping) and frozen by
passing through a sophisticated machine.
The rapid freezing helps to preserve the texture and moisture of the product saving a dry, chewy
texture when thawed.<br/><br/>

<b>7: Do you follow halal standards?</b><br/><br/>
Yes, our suppliers for frozen and fresh meat follow halal standards.<br/><br/>

<b>8: How will my meat stay fresh whilst being delivered?</b><br/><br/>
All the products will be delivered in a vehicle having a frozen container. This means the
freshness is sealed in once frozen and delivered to you in great condition. Once delivered, all
you have to do is pop your meat into the freezer and its as easy as that.<br/><br/>
