WorldPayXMLRedirect Payment Gateway
===================================

To use the WorldPayXMLRedirect payment gateway you will need to set up a 
merchant account with WorldPay and set up the module in KonaKart.

NOTE:

In tomcat 8.0.42 by default the ^ character was not allowed in request URLs.
WorldPay sends status information in URLs containing the ^ character.
Therefore, by default, the module will not work on tomcat v8.0.42.

Supported customers should make contact with us to dicuss a workaround.
